# Coupon-Recommendation-System-Using-User-Behavior-Data
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a user will accept a coupon based on several factors, such as weather, passenger information, time of day, and more. The dataset is drawn from an in-vehicle environment where recommendations are offered to users, and the goal is to make predictions.
